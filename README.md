<h1>SQBRA Interpreter</h1>
<h2>Interpreter for the SquareBracket Programming Language</h2>
<p>SquareBracket is a simple programming language designed to make the execution of small algorithms and math scripts easy. It has a syntax that is easy to learn and uses intuitive commands to perform mathematical operations, create variables, and control program flow. It is designed to be extensible and many more functions will be added in future versions to make it more powerful. With its focus on simplicity and ease of use, SquareBracket is a good choice for anyone looking to quickly and easily create and execute mathematical algorithms and scripts. Small bugs may still occur. The interpreter is lightweight  and completely implemented in C++.</p>
