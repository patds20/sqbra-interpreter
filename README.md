<h1>SQBRA Interpreter <i>(Version 1.3.1)</i></h1>
<h2>Interpreter for the SquareBracket Programming Language</h2>
<p>SquareBracket is a <b>simple programming language</b> designed to make the execution of small algorithms and math scripts easy. It has a syntax that is <b>easy to learn</b> and uses intuitive commands to perform mathematical operations, create variables, and control program flow. It is designed to be extensible and many <b>more functions will be added in future versions</b> to make it more powerful. With its focus on simplicity and ease of use, SquareBracket is a good choice for anyone looking to quickly and easily create and execute mathematical algorithms and scripts. Small bugs may still occur. The interpreter is lightweight and completely <b>implemented in C++</b>.</p>
